The dataset includes 13283 images.
Cards are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.28 percent of pixels
